# Minecraft 2D
This project has been at the back of mind, I am rewriting it after having gained more experience in Java, however, this is probably not the final rewrite of this project, there is more to come.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to make a resemblance of the game Minecraft in a 2D format, using only the Java Swing and AWT library because masochism.


Anything else like JSON readers have to manually written (bugs galore)


And also to follow the way the actual code in Minecraft is structured.


Infinite map.


And usage of regular Minecraft resource packs.


And support for mods with the use of a mod loader (all the required methods should already exist)
