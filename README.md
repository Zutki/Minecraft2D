# Minecraft 2D
Minecraft 2D is a game built to resemble the game Minecraft developed by Mojang Studios in a 2D format, while providing support for creations built for Minecraft such as resource packs.
A major goal of the game is to provide mod support of the get-go.

## Note:
In no way am I a good java programmer, this is a rewrite of the entire project. Almost all the code here is probably going to be completely different from any of the original code.
And finally, one of my major downfalls as a person. This project has a lifespan, I will work on it for a bit, however, I will eventually stop working on it. So if you are somehow actually interested in seeing this project finish. Feel free to harass me to work on it.

## Goals
- To in a way follow a proper structure based loosely on the way Fabric and Forge handle Minecraft mappings.
- Have an infinite map.
- Use regular minecraft resource packs for compatibility with already existing creations.
- To have a built-in mod loader. The idea is to have the game be constructed in way where mod support is kept in mind.
- Proper Javadoc documentation

## Info
The version that is provided with each class indicated the version of the file, not the version of the game it's meant for

## Mod Loader Information
The mod loader will have some limitations that may later get solved.

### Current ***Known*** mod support limitations
- Cannot make custom registry types without doing things like extending the registry class to add support
