# Minecraft2D

This project is an experiment that I am doing to see if I can create some resemblence of Minecraft. I am writing this
all in Java and limiting myself to not using any game libraries.

This project has no dependencies as all libraries used are part of the default JDK installation.

## Controls:
- WASD or Arrow Keys to move player
- F1 to toggle debug mode

## Useful info:

- Java version: 17 (openJDK)
- Asset Credit: Mojang Studio
- Using the Java Swing and AWT libraries
- Example GitHub which has a lot of **very** useful
