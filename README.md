# Minecraft2D
This project is an experiment that I am doing to see if I can create some resemblence of Minecraft. I am writing this all in Java and limiting myself to not using any game libraries.

This project has no dependencies as all libraries used are part of the default JDK installation.

## Useful info:
- Java version: 17 (openJDK)
- Asset Credit: Mojang Studio
- Using the Java Swing and AWT libraries
- Example github which has a lot of **very** useful info: [here](https://github.com/learncodebygaming/java_2d_game/blob/master/Board.java)

## TODO:
- [x] Movable Player 
- [x] World Generation debug mode
  - Draw a grid of all the squares on the world
- [ ] World generation with varied blocks
- [ ] World height generation with perlin noise
- [x] Proper player image
- [ ] sound: [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/577724/trouble-playing-wav-in-java/577926#577926)
